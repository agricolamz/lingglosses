/article/5084/galley/13430/download/,"AbbreviationsGlossing conventions for sign language examples: Signs are glossed with an approximate translation in SMALL CAPS. Since the words in the examples do not reflect the shape of the signs, but their meanings, they are comparable to interlinear glosses and not to transcriptions used for spoken languages. If more than one word is necessary to gloss a meaning, a point is used (GO.DOWN); ^ is used for compounds; fingerspelled sequences are separated by dashes: A-N-N-A ‘Anna’. IX stands for index, that is, a pointing sign, and is followed by a number for 1st and 2nd person (pointing to the signer: IX-1 or the addressee: IX-2), or by a letter: IX-A to keep track of arbitrary locations. Agreeing verbs are also accompanied by letters to represent locations that they agree with. PL stands for plural marking, and DISTR is distributive marking; they are expressed by different types of reduplication. Classifier predicates are glossed as follows: CL for classifier, followed by the abbreviation for the type of classifier in subscript (we – whole-entity, hl – handling, bp – body part, in – instrumental, see Section 6 for an explanation), followed by the handshape between brackets, and a description of the meaning of the movement or location predicate.Handshapes are represented by letters and numbers, and should be interpreted using the following guide:1: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_001.png2: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_015.png2b: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_017.png5: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_077.png5b: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_081.pngb: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_091.pngc: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_110.pngs: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_256.pngh: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_126.pngan: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_134.pngbi: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_161.pngy: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISWA_Hand_BaseSymbol_155.pngTraditionally, a line above the glosses is used to represent (the scope of) non-manuals, but since non-manuals are not crucial for this study, a less space-demanding convention is adopted; that is, the / sign on both sides is used for the non-manual marking topicalization. Each example from the RSL corpus is followed by a direct URL link to this example (note, however, that registration is required to access the corpus data), and each elicited example is followed by the code of the signer it was elicited from (S1 to S4).Abbreviations for sign languages: ASL – American Sign Language; RSL – Russian Sign Language.Abbreviations in spoken language examples:ABS – absolutive; ERG – ergative; INST – instrumental; INTER – inter-essive; OBL – oblique; PST – past tense."

/article/4834/galley/13572/download/,"Abbreviations TerminologyPAL: palatalizationPoA: place of articulationVD = vowel deletion (Section 2): The deletion of unstressed high vowels in Greek dialects, esp. of the Northern variety.Primary/full PAL (Section 3.1): Type of PAL where the PoA of the target shifts to the palatal region. Triggers are front vocoids /i e j/. Targets in all dialects are velars, but in Northern dialects some coronals are affected too.Simple PAL (Section 3.1): Subtype of primary/full PAL, triggered by the front vowels /i e/. The trigger remains intact in the structure after PAL has applied.Extreme PAL (Section 3.1): Subtype of primary/full PAL, where the trigger /j/ coalesces with the target consonant of PAL.Secondary PAL (Section 3.2): Type of PAL that does not exist in Greek; its typical trait is F2 raising and may be accompanied by other acoustic cues, such as frication, aspiration or lengthening.Strengthened PAL (Section 3.2): Type of PAL specific to Northern Greek dialects. Similar to secondary PAL in the acoustic cues it presents, but crucially lacks F2 raising. The trigger (unstressed vowel /i/) is unpronounced and there is change in PoA of target consonant for velars and /s z n l/, while there is no PoA change of target consonant after PAL has applied for labials and the remaining coronal consonants.GH = Glide hardening (Section 4): A process complementary to PAL, occurring next to target consonants resistant to PAL. It turns glides to palatal fricatives (or stops), without changing the PoA of the target."
